    "**Summary:** This project analyzes data from the players.csv dataset, which contains information about 196 individual players on a Minecraft server, including their experience level, newsletter subscriptifon status, hashed email address, playtime, name, gender, and age.\n",

    "| `hashedEmail` | String (`chr`) | Unique anonymized identifier for each player. | `f6daba4...` |\n",
    "| `played_hours` | Numeric (`dbl`) | Total number of hours the player has spent playing. | `30.3` |\n",
    "| `name` | String (`chr`) | Player’s first name. | `Morgan` |\n",

    "<h3>Direct Observations and Problems</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **experience** variable may represent skill progression and could be useful in predicting playtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **hashedEmail** variable appears to be the unique player identifier, but is not relevant for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **played_hours** variable contains many zeros, possibly representing new players who have not yet begun playing; hwoever, this might affect our later prediction in answering the question based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **gender** variable contains has many different responses, such as “Other”, “Two-Spirited”, “Prefer not to say”, etc. This might make it hard to group or summarize.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Age** variable has some missing values, which must be handled before modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>other potential issue</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data may not represent all types of players (for example, older players or casual players may be missing).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- If some of the data are self-recorded (such as age), the outcome when using this data set might not be that accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>how the data were collected</h3>\n",
    "<p> A research group in Computer Science at UBC, led by Frank Wood, is collecting data about how people play video games. They have set up a Minecraft serverLinks to an external site., and players' actions are recorded as they navigate through the world. </p >"
