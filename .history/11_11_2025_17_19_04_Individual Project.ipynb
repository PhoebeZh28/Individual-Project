    "- Many players have 0 played hours, which may indicate that they have just signed up and haven’t actually played. This might affect our later prediction in answering the question based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The gender column has many different responses, such as “Other”, “Two-Spirited”, “Prefer not to say”, etc. This might make it hard to group or summarize.\n",
