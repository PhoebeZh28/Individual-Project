    "- The **experience** variable may represent skill progression and could be useful in predicting playtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **hashedEmail** variable appears to be the unique player identifier, but is not relevant for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **played_hours** variable contains many zeros, possibly representing new players who have not yet begun playing; hwoever, this might affect our later prediction in answering the question based on the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **gender** variable contains has many different responses, such as “Other”, “Two-Spirited”, “Prefer not to say”, etc. This might make it hard to group or summarize.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **Age** variable has some missing values, which must be handled before modelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Other Potential Issue</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data may not represent all types of players (for example, older players or casual players may be missing).\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Data by self-recording (such as age) may contain errors.\n",

    "<h2>(4) Methods and Plan</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Methond</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> The method that I might be using to address the question \"Can the player's total playtime and age predict whether they subscribe to the newsletter in the player database?\" will be the KNN regression model. This will allow me to classify players as \"subscribers\" and \"non-subscribers\" based on their playtime and age.</p >\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Why is this method appropriate?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> This method is appropriate because KNN regression works well for numeric values. In addition, KNN regression also does not assume any specific relation between the predictor and outcome, which will be helpful to use since the age and playtime might have a non-linear relationship with the subscription. </p >\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Which assumptions are required, if any, to apply the method selected?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    " - The data must be scaled when using it. \n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>What are the potential limitations or weaknesses of the method selected?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    " - the choice of k.\n",
    " - Outliers, especially when dealing with the game time data, as game time has a range from 0 to over 200 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>How are you going to compare and select the model?</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p> I’ll use k-fold cross-validation (around 5 folds) on the training data to choose a good value for k. Model performance will be compared mainly through accuracy and the misclassification rate. </p >\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>How are you going to process the data to apply the model? </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>I’ll keep only the variables I need (played_hours, Age, and subscribe), remove missing values, and standardize the numeric predictors. I’ll also take a quick look at any extreme values in playtime since they might affect the distance calculations.</p >\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>After cleaning and scaling, I will use 70% of the data for training and 30% for testing. The training set will be used for all model development, including scaling, tuning the number of neighbours (k), and running cross-validation. I plan to use 5-fold cross-validation within the training set to select the best k and ensure the model generalizes well. The test set will remain untouched until the final evaluation to provide an estimate of model performance.</p >"
